This repository contain the source code project based on the work by Howard Long, G6LVB. 
It includes the modifications I made so that the controller, in this case the Fox Delta ST2-USB 
produced by Dinesh Gajjar, VU2FD, will allow for calibration points at 0, 90, 180, 270,
and 360 degres. 

This project can be loaded into the MPLAB X IDE using the CC5X compiler to program your own 16F876A PIC.

The original code was published without any licensing requirement, so this code is also made available 
license free.
